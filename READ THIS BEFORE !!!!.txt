Basics of data struture

1.What are data struture?

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

2.Why use data struture?

For faster access to data,for efficient storage, keeping it organized.

3.What is iterable object?

Any object is called iterable if we can access individual objects from it, bascially iterating through the object.

We iterate through object through loops.

4. What are index values?

Every element inside a iterbale object has a uniqiue  value called index, it refers to a position within an ordered data struture.

5.What are ordered data struture.

Ordered data structures store elements in sequence of their insertion.(tuples,lists)

6.What are unordered data 

Un-ordered data structure don't store data in order of their insertion (Sets,Dictionary)


7.Indexing in data struture 

consider a list of alphabets

char=["a","b","c"]

indexing in python starts from 0 

so "a"=0 ,"b"=1,"c"=2 and so on

Elements can be accessed by their index values for example

char[0] will return "a"


8.Concept of index ranges

suppose we have a list of chars

chars=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
and we want elements from 1 to 4 only

we use something calles as alicing

concept of slicing

[starting index:ending index -1]


index ranges go from starting to ending - 1 index

so if we want to access elements from 1 to 4 we will write something like this

[0:5] this will go till index 0 to 4 thus giving elements from 1 to 4



9.Concept of striding

striding allows us to access elements in steps for example we have a list of numbers
nums=[1,2,3,4,5,6] and we want to access every second element in it

striding syntax

[start:end:steps]

print(nums[0:5:2])



10.If you don't know the ending of a list/tuple/array you can use len() functions

len() returns the lenght or total elements in the list

we can re-write the previous case like this

print(nums[0:len(nums):2])


11.some concepts of slicing

1.[:]  returns whole thing

2.[0:] returns whole thing

3.[-1] returns last element

4.[:-1] returns elements from 0 to last element-1

5.[::-1] reverses the list or any other object like tuples,strings etc.

6.[::-1] reverses the list, prints every second element from reverses

7.[-1:0]  returns nothing

8.[:3] by default python adds a 0 at start
